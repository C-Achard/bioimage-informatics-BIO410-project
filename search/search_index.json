The plugin is designed to analyze the dynamics of DNA replication in bacteria, specifically the movement of the replisome.</p> <p>Bacteria are assigned to colonies using the DIC channel, and GFP-tagged DNaN in the second channel is used to track the replisome. The plugin can be used to track the movement of the replisome.</p> <p>Various plots and statistics can be generated from the data.</p>"},{"location":"about/#installation","title":"Installation","text":"<p>To install the plugin, take the provided .jar file and place it in the plugins folder of your ImageJ installation. </p> <p>The plugin will then be available in the ImageJ menu under Plugins &gt; Replisome Analysis.</p>"}]}
